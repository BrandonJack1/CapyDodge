# CapyDodge

Capy Dodge represents my interest in game designâ€”a 2D arcade-style mobile game I crafted as a personal project. The concept is simple: tilt your device to gather apples while avoiding bouncing acorns in the play area. As time progresses, the challenge intensifies with faster acorn spawns. Gathering 10 apples grants you a net, allowing you to catch acorns for points and string together combos by swiftly collecting them in succession. 

I utilized Unity and C# to develop the game, and I'm proud to say that 98% of the in-game sprites are my original creations. I integrated Apples Game Center Leaderboard support using the Apple Gamekit for a competitive edge. I also integrated in-app purchases and ads using the Unity Ads SDK. Capy Dodge is also available in 5 different languages (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German)

I published Capy Dodge to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and it has since accumulated over 30,000 downloads with 4.5+ stars. It even got picked by Apple App Store Editors to be featured in "New Games we Love"

Since January, I've diligently updated Capy Dodge, introducing new player skins, items, and gameplay enhancements. This ongoing support demonstrates my commitment to keeping the game engaging and enjoyable.
